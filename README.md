It seems like your message got cut off or there was a misunderstanding. I assume you're asking me to keep all the content within the original structure and perhaps refine it based on the repository link provided (`https://github.com/sviv1/FormiAssignment2Vivek`). Since I can’t access the actual repository, I’ll stick to the provided structure and ensure everything stays "in the box" (i.e., within the README format you shared). Below is the polished README, ready for you to copy and paste directly into your GitHub repository. You can fill in the placeholders with specifics about your project.
